Accessibility	tags	<p>Accessibility is a term that is widely spread in the web. In real life a place is accessible when it can be easily reached by different routes, means and by all people including ones with disabilities. In the web site terminology this concept is very similar, the web site is accessible when each page can easily be reached through links which are placed in a way that the information can easily be found. Generally, an ideal approach is to place links in the web site so that each web page can be found by navigating from the home page using no more than 3 clicks. The page must have a SEO friendly URL, meta tags that helps robots such as search engines to classify the content of the web page, a good guideline is to have a page with no more than 30/40 links per page, no use JavaScript to hide links or content unless is necessary, content should be consistent amount the site, the topics should be related to each other.</p>	filtered_html	0		
Audio & Video	tags	<p>In publishing sector, forums, blogs, social media, image gallery: news, events, images and videos are published daily. As the content of such web sites grows exponentially over the time, Drupal is very powerful content management system to support categorisation of the content using taxonomies. The content of the web pages (nodes, blocks, views) can be classified and easily be found through a search form, a calendar, a list of categories, references, related topics, latest articles, top hits, my favourites, etc..</p>	filtered_html	1		
Content Management	tags	<p>A Content Management System is a software that allows a users such as an administrator or editor to publish or edit existing content of the web site. Drupal is built in PHP and MySQL, all the content is saved in nodes, blocks, taxonomies, content types. Drupal used templates to displays content which can also be aggregated through views. We can set up your custom content types and templates to display them.</p>	filtered_html	2		
Custom Modules	tags	<p>As Drupal is written in PHP there is no limit to what you can do with it. You can use a lot of existing modules but you can also create your custom solution to tailor the application to your specific needs. You only need to create a custom module that extends the most popular Drupal hooks: <i>hook_init(), hook_form_alter(), hook_schema(), hook_theme(), hook_install(), hook_permission(), hook_menu()</i></p>	filtered_html	3		
Database Integration	tags	<p>Drupal can also be integrated with other complex system that uses other databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL Server. In the settings.php you can specify multiple data base connections so that the application can grab the information from more than one data base. I worked in a projects where Drupal was used only to store the content for the front-end and most of the heavy data was stored in a different data base. I have also been involved in headless Drupal projects where Drupal is used only to store the data and the front end use a different technology such as Angular, Jequery calls that grab the content from Drupal using a set of Drupal API web services.</p>	filtered_html	4		
Drupal consulting	tags	<p>Drupal is a very complex framework that works primarily with a set of core predefined hooks (in the core modules folder). A Hook is just a normal function written in PHP, the greatest difference is that this special function can be used and extended in Drupal by developing new modules. There are a lot of contributes modules that extend these hooks, they usually are placed in sites/module/contrib. If you need something more specific than you can create your own module and place it in sites/module/custom. Note: never modify an existing core or contributed module, always create your custom module. The great advantage of this approach is the modularity: re-use exiting module by keeping them very generic so that they can easily be shared among the modules.</p>	filtered_html	5		
eCommerce / Online Store	tags	<p>Even though Drupal was not original built for supporting great eCommerce systems such as other open source framework like Magento, it has lot of modules to set up an online stores. We can set up products, which are a special content type with a field for the price, category, stock, colour, size. There is a module that implement the baskets and other modules that support different payment gateways such as PayPal, Barclays card and all different card association such as Visa/MasterCard/American Express.</p>	filtered_html	6		
Email Marketing	tags	<p>Drupal is ideal to create registration forms so that you can keep a list of your clients with their details such as email address, full name, address and other preferences. Therefore you can use the Drupal news letter system to send to your customers the most up to dated offers and news about your web site. Drupal also supports lot of Free Mail Marketing Solutions such as MailChimp.</p>	filtered_html	7		
Increase Donations	tags	<p>Many Charities have been using Drupal to rise money. You just need to set up a registration form and linked it to a payment Gateway. You do not need a very elaborated web site, usually a campaign just need a front page with a form. Drupal can be easily be set up, you only need to buy a hosting package to run PHP on a Linux Server and a MySQL database.</p>	filtered_html	9		
Increase Sales	tags	<p>You can already have a well established Ecommerce system, but Drupal can be used to set up a sub domain to host news, blog or a forums about your products. Or you can set up an application to create a competition in Faceboock or pull your latest twitts from Twitter.</p>	filtered_html	10		
Information Architecture	tags	<p>One of the greatest advantage of Drupal is that it is extremely flexible. This leave to the developer lot of freedom on how to implement the solution. Basically there are lot of different ways to achieve the same goal. The best ways to use Drupal is to set up an architecture that will be scalable for your application. The best approach is to set up a different content types or entities, one for each specific real entity. You can cross reference entities using entity reference so do not create only one entity that host the whole application data, but create relations between small entities so that data is stored efficiently and it will be easier to scale and it will have higher performance. If you need to display aggregated information you can use views to JOIN multiple entities.</p>	filtered_html	11		
Integrated Content Strategy	tags	<p>In your Strategy you should decide: how many content type should I have? Should I allow user registration? If so, which roles and permissions should I set up? Should all content be visible to all users roles? What about anonymous users? How heavily should I be using views, blocks, form API or variables? Note: views sometimes can be very slow, therefore try to use them efficiently, the content of the nodes should always be displayed though specific content types templates rather then views: page-news.tpl.php, do not use views with contextual filters that cannot be efficiently retrieved (such as LIKE on string).</p>	filtered_html	12		
Investments	tags	<p>Many companies in the financial sectors started to use Drupal because it is very secure and scalable. Drupal has got a very high level of security as you can set up different roles with different level of permissions. This guarantee that when a user log-in, he can access, edit only to his personal sensitive data and nobody can have access to it.</p>	filtered_html	0		
Mobile Development	tags	<p>A web site must be easily accessible using different mobile devices and tablets with different screen resolutions and widths which usually are between 320px up to 800px. The web site must be displayed properly on all these different resolutions. The Bootstrap Theme is a FREE framework that can be used as a Drupal Theme to implement this solution.</p>	filtered_html	13		
Mobile Websites	tags	<p>Today a big chunk of the web traffic is made by mobile devices. Each device can have different screen sizes (usually with a width of 320 pixels), but the aim is to create a web site that can work reasonably well with all these kind of different small devices. All Drupal functionalities such as registration form must be built in a way that user can use the form for these small devices, users can still login from them to check their account, check, edit or make new orders, find new products. All the Drupal functionalities should be active also for these small devices so that there are no limitations as the screen resolution became smaller.</p>	filtered_html	14		
Multi-Language Websites	tags	<p>The Multi language module - i18n has got plenty of features to translate in different languages all the content of your web sites. Everything can be translated: notes, titles, views, blocks, taxonomies, menus. By default Drupal allows the translation for more than 200 default languages. You only need to enable the module and add the translation in each language.</p>	filtered_html	15

Peer to peer lending	tags	<p>In the recent years I have been involved as Drupal Developer in a very new innovative financial sector: Peer to peer lending.</p>\r\n<p>In this particular financial services, there are 2 type of users: Lenders and Borrowers. The principle is very simple: a Lender register to the web site to invest money which will be lent to people that are looking to borrow money. The Peer to peer lending company is like an intermediate that helps both users to achieve the following goals:</p>\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="span2 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Lenders</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #56A11A;">Want a good return on their money</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span3 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Peer to peer web site</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #1A3EA1;">Find a fair agreement that match both the Borrowers and Lenders expectation</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span2 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Borrowers</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #56A11A;">Want cheap and affordable loans</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>Peer to peer lending Explained</h4>\r\n<p>In order to minimise the risk for the lenders, the Peer to peer web site lend the investor money on different loans having different interest rates: higher risk returns higher interest. Usually only 1% of the lender portfolio is invested on a loan so that the lender spread his risk over at least 100 different borrowers; The reason is very simple: DO NOT PUT YOUR EGGS IN A SINGLE BASKET as a borrower may default (with a very small probability) on the loan, the lender will still make a profit in the overall.</p>\r\n<p>The loan with low risk (category A,B,C) usually usually offers interest rate up to 4-6% and they have a default rate less than 0.08%, as the rate goes higher (default rate also goes slightly higher such as 1% default rate for interest rates between 10-15%) the default rate may increase even up to to 10% for the highest level of risk which usually offer an unbelievable interest rate between 25% / 30%!</p>\r\n<p>On average each Peer to peer lending web site that I know usually offers a product with an income guaranteed of at least 3.5% with any withdrawal fee, and more risky product that offers very good yields up to 7-8% per years on product that are exposed on more risky loans (with interest rate between 25% / 30%, but with default rate around 5-10%!). Each product satisfy the level of risk appetite of each lender.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A very simple example</h4>\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="span1 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Mister Smith</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #56A11A;">Invest £2,000</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span3 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Peer to peer web site</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #1A3EA1;">Find and approve scrupulous 200 Borrowers that pass their risk criterial and allocate £10 on each loan. Before a loan is approved it has to pass a very strict credit, affordability check which it is done by an underwriter with the helps of fraud and credit agency which highlight the credibility of the borrower.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span3 promo" style="padding: 10px;">\r\n<h3>Borrowers</h3>\r\n<p class="lead" style="color: #56A11A;">The system spread the risk over different risk categories and different terms. For example 120 loans are in the lower category (A,B), 60 on intermediate risk (C,D) and only 20 on the highest category(E) with an average interest rate around 11%, which will give after default a rate of around 6-7% depending on the loan book default rate (which usually is between 0.05-1%).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the lender does not need to do anything: Only need to put money in and then wait for the repayments to start coming back each month. Interest also is repaid monthly so the lender can decide to re-invest each month all the returns</p>\r\n	filtered_html	0		<h2><a href="https://www.zopa.com/loans/mgm/060d9dcd173f">Gets a loan or lends over &pound;2,000 in Zopa and get a &pound;50 Bonus!</a></h2>\r\n<div class="promo">\r\n<p class="lead">The only thing that you need to do is to register in Zopa, Transfer in &pound;2,000 and then choose between the 3 different available product.

Property investment	tags	<p>It is very interesting to observe that since 1990 the average house price in the UK are tripled from &pound;60K to &pound;180K. Basically since 1990 for the last 26 years the average UK Property price increase has been 4.74% per year. There was a huge rise between 1996 to 2006 with a 9.5% increase per year, very lucky who bought in 1996 and sold it in 2006. As we all know during the recession that started from 2006 up to 2016 the house price rose on average only 2% per year, so less lucky were who bought it around 2006, the house market started to improve from 2011 with a decent yearly average increase of 6% from 2011 till 2016 which is almost 30% more in just 5 years! After the Brexit, now there is very interesting question: what is going to happen in UK to the Property Market? There is certainly a risk in Buying a Property in UK, but if you plan to invest for at least 5/10 years an decent yearly average return may be guaranteed if it will follow the trend of the last 26 years, even though the current trend is not extremely promising: looks like a bubble: "For how long can it keep flying up?"</p>	filtered_html	0		<div class="promo">\r\n<p class="lead">Average House Prices in UK has always grown in the last 26 years, "what is going to happen next?"</p>\r\n<p>"Should I still invest in a Property in UK"? Interest Base rate now is only 0.5%, but the house prices are extremely high at the moment. Like in 2006 house price may increase slowly and the interest rates may go up which increase the cost of your mortgage.</p>\r\n</div>
Saving accounts	tags	<p>Today most of the saving accounts and Cash ISA in the UK offer annual interest rates between 0.5% up 1%. If you are looking for higher annual interest rates such as 2% and you intend to save money for your children then you have to start looking at some product such as a Kid's Regular Saver where the interest is higher, but the money is locked for at least a year and the account can be opened only in name of your child. One of the best Kid's Regular Saver at the moment is offered by Halifax which currently offer an 4% GROSS annual interest rate for kids from 0 to 16 years old, deposits are up to &pound;100 at month which is &pound;1,200 for the first year. This product may work well for you only if you plan to save for a very long time and you want to lock your money till your kid will be 16 years old. Another good saving account that I know is the 123 Santander Account where you can get Cash Back on your bills and they also offer an annual interest rate of 3%, but you have to pay a monthly fee of &pound;5 and the interest is paid only on amount up to &pound;20,000. After the &pound;60 annual fees (&pound;5 per month), on an investment of &pound;20,000 this will be equivalent to an interest rate of 2.7% per year (&pound;600 - &pound;60 NET interest).</p>	filtered_html	0		
Search Engine Optimization	tags	<p>Drupal supporting the search engine optimisation is one of the best feature of Drupal. As the framework is hosted in Lunux (one of the best open source server on the planet), it uses a great advanced feature of apache web server to create path aliases to the system urls. The apache system rewrite module allows to set up rules to have extremely friendly URLs: for example: /services instead of ?q=node/23.</p>\r\n<p>You just need to add this directive in the .htaccess file:<br/>\r\n<i>RewriteRule ^videos/(.*)$ index.php?q=videos&keyword=$1 [L,QSA]</i><br/>\r\n<i>RewriteRule ^links/(.*)$ index.php?q=taxonomy/term/23&LinkId=$1 [L,QSA]</i><br/>\r\n<i>RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]</i><br/>\r\n</p>	filtered_html	16		
Stocks and Shares	tags	<p>Stocks and Shares is a very delicate topics when we talk about investments. I believe that since the start of the financial recession in 2007/2008 at least 70-80% of the investors in the Stock Market lost a lot of their money, I know and I have heard of Beginner Investors who have lost even everything (their money plus what they borrowed from their family and friends)! It's a very difficult and risky time to invest in the stock market at the moment: Crude Oil fell from $150 per barrel in 2008 to $32 per Barrel in the beginning of 2016! Which is a drop of almost 500%. Even Gold that has always been considered for years a safe Heaven has dropped from $2,000 per ounce in 2011 to $1,200 per ounce in the beginning of 2016 (40% drop in 5 years!). I believe that the only people who made some money in the Stock Market during recession time are the Investors who mostly playing short!</p>	filtered_html	0		<div class="promo">\r\n<p class="lead">People are playing big short now which makes it even more volatile and risky!</p>\r\n<p>A short position technically is when an Investor bet against the price of a commodity or stock, basically they make money when the price goes down. But only professional traders know these techniques as they usually are more risky then just easily buy and wait which works only when the market grows slowly. But it is 100% loss guaranteed during recession time.</p>\r\n</div>
System (CMS)	tags	<p>With our Drupal expertise, we built very complex system such as CRM (Custom Relation Management), Multi language sites, Mobile Responsive web sites. Drupal is ideal to build complex systems as content management system has got plenty of features to set up content types, views, blocks, taxonomies. Drupal also support the API web services integration so that Drupal can communicate with other complex system using XML or Json protocol.</p>	filtered_html	17		
Training & Consultation	tags	<p>Thinking about using Drupal for your web site? We helped already lot of agencies and most of our clients to install Drupal and we assist them to create their costumed content management system.

Our director, Pasquale Laudonio works mainly as a contractor and he performs all his consultancy work on the client side. Our daily rate is very competitive. Please <a href="/contacts">contact us</a> for more information.</p>	filtered_html	18		
Usability Testing	tags	<p>We always test our code, specially if we write specific custom modules. When we deploy the application, we set up php-test units that run in order to validate the quality of our code. The best procedure to release code is to create different branches for different tickets and sub tasks so that they can be deployed individually and incrementally in a Agile way. The code must always be merged through a pull request, and must be reviewed by another developer before the merge. The priority of the Tickets must follow a weekly plan so that each deliverable can be individually estimated, developed and delivered on time.</p>	filtered_html	19		
User account registration	tags	<p>In Drupal the registration process already comes in the core hooks functionality. We don't need to install any extra module. The main registration functionalities are: registration form, forgot password, user log-in, welcome email. The super admin has got the permissions to block users, create new users, add user roles, set permissions so that new users can only use a limited part of the CMS. For example: edit their own content, upload their profile picture, add a comment or post a new item in the forum or create their own blog.</p>	filtered_html	8		
Web & Interactive Design	tags	<p>We built very advanced themes from very professional design. In order to make a theme very appealing and look very gorgeous and elegant you need an excellent web and interactive design. Our managing director, Pasquale Laudonio has built plenty of responsive Drupal Themes in Drupal. As contractor is currently works mainly as Backend Drupal developer, but he's very familiar with the latest HTML / CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and Angular frameworks. We believe that working with Drupal, it is essential a good understanding of the front end, we cannot build very professional web sites in drupal if you cannot site up an advanced Drupal responsive theme.</p>	filtered_html	20		
Web Statistics & Analysis	tags	<p>At the end of the day you need to count how many people visited your web site, which sections are most popular and which links are most clicked and which pages attract most visitors. Drupal supports advanced feature to track your visits using the advanced Google analytics module, you just need to create an account in Google Analytics and then we will install and set up this amazing module for you on your site.</p>	filtered_html	21		
Web Strategy	tags	<p>Where would you like your web site to be in 1 year? In 3 years or in 10 years? You need to plan for a long term strategy to decide in which direction your web site is going to move on the near future and on the long term. Drupal is also evolving, currently the most stable version is the 7, but they recently lanched Drupal 8. The reasons why Drupal evolves is because it implements the most recent and advanced web development techniques. It also became more and more secure over the years, lot of security issues have been fixed in the latest releases, now Drupal has became a CMS solution that even some very important firms started to use.</p>	filtered_html	22
